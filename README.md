The languages we will be using for the front end will be html, javascript and css.
<br> <br> The back end will using node js as a server language and mongodb as the database.
We will be also using mongoose as a schema language to make sure everything gets added to the database correctly.<br> we also used server side checks to make sure all the data is correct.
<br> mocha and supertest were used so regression testing is easier.
<br> our env file was not committed due to it containing api codes but if needed we can provide the env file.
